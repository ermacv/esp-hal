//! The IPC of a dual-core RISC-V chip.
//!
//! A CPU reaches its own CLINT through one alias, and the CLINT of the other CPU through
//! another alias. The machine software interrupt therefore carries the call in both directions.
//!
//! The interrupt enters through the CPU's vector table like every other vectored interrupt:
//! the vectored dispatcher runs the posted function ([`dispatch`]), and the HAL writes no entry
//! of its own into that table. Only a CPU whose RTOS registered a context-switch handler binds
//! [`ipc_handler`] to the line directly, because that handler returns into the context the RTOS
//! chooses.
